Waves_JS is the repository home for www.cartesianother.com/waves. This site is intended to compare three different popular California surf spots to compare against each other. The idea behind it is to indicate to a user what the best option is each day, depending on data pulled from worldweatheronline, compiled and compared against the other locations.

This project is utilizes multiple $.ajax functions ranging from pulling html content from separate files, calling external sources to utilize and display that data, and using json data objects to store location information and gallery calls.

Stylistically, this site is being built mobile first, with default functions optimized towards a mobile experience. This means that default build behavior includes a toggled main navigation. Media queries will be geared towards four main viewport sizes: X-Small [320px - 480px], Small [481 - 767px], Medium [768px - 1024px] and Large [> 1025px].
